SEVEN lawmakers from Cebu allegedly funneled at least P188.6 million in three years to nine non-government organizations (NGOs), which government auditors later said were dubious or highly irregular.
	The Commission on Audit (COA), in a report released in August 2013, said that more than 80 NGOs received public funds from the executive department in 2007 to 2009, but were not legally authorized to do so.
	They also were not selected by public bidding, failed to submit to government inspections or audits that would have shown what they did with the funds, or could not be located in their given addresses, among other lapses.
	The nine NGOs that received the funds in those three years from Cebuano members of the House of Representatives are not among the groups allegedly organized by businesswoman Janet Lim-Napoles.
	However, the three implementing agencies that worked with the congressmen and the NGOs were all implicated in the plunder and malversation cases filed in September by the Department of Justice (DOJ) against three senators, Napoles and 34 others. 
	These implementing agencies are the National Agribusiness Corp. (NABCOR), Technology Resource Center (TRC) and National Livelihood Development Corp. (NLDC).
	Antonio Cuenco, former congressman of Cebu City’s South 
District, denied giving P54.64 million of his Priority Development Assistance Funds (PDAF) to dubious organizations He said some of the amount was charged to his pork barrel “by mistake.”
	In its report, COA said that aside from Cuenco, these Cebuano lawmakers also recommended these amounts for certain NGOs in the three years covered by its special audit:
* Nerissa Soon-Ruiz (Province, 6th district), P38.54 million for three NGOs;
* Clavel Asas-Martinez (Province, 4th district), P33.6 million to two NGOs;
* Eduardo Gullas (Province, 1st district), P28.4 million to two NGOs;
* Antonio Yapha (Province, 3rd district), P19.3 million to two NGOs; 
* Ramon Durano VI (Province, 5th district), P7.2 million to one NGO; and
* Benhur Salimbangon (Province, 4th district), P7 million to one NGO.
